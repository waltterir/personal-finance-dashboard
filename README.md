# Personal Finance Dashboard (WIP)

A personal finance dashboard project built with **React + TypeScript**.

The goal of this project is to create a clean and scalable dashboard UI for tracking personal finances, including transactions, budgets and monthly summaries.

> Current status: Early MVP with routing, pages and mock data in place.

## Why I'm building this

I wanted a realistic product-style project where I can practice building a scalable frontend codebase and iterating from an MVP towards a more complete application.
